Weather forecasting is the use of scientific knowledge and technology to predict the atmosphere in a specific location and time. It's a way to predict weather conditions like cloud cover, rain, snow, wind speed, and temperature before they happen. Weather forecasts can help people decide what to wear, stay inside, or evacuate.
